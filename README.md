## More Bugs

After you fix one bug and have it reviewed and accepted, you can try fixing a second bug.

Choose a bug from the [Bug Backlog list](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/project/board/782/) (i.e.: not a "good first bug").

Use the same workflow and reach out to an instructor if you get stuck. And if we can't figure it out, you can politely ask the iOS Wikipedia team for help.
